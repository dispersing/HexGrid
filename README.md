# HexGrid
Functions for creating hexagonal grids in R.

Thank you for visiting this git.  I've created a suite of functions that allow users of the R language and programming environment to:
* create hexagonal grids
 * as rectangular and
 * as hexagonal grids
* generate hexagonal distance matrices
* plot
 * distance matrices
 * either type of hexagonal grid
This is obviously in progress, but please feel freel to fork or watch.

Thanks.
